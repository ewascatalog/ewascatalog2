   <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p class="small">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>The EWAS Catalog was developed and is maintained by the Intergrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) at the University of Bristol. The Catalog was founded by the IEU in October 2017 by James Staley and was developed to enable the scientific community to search results from epigenome-wide association studies of DNA methylation. <br></br> The Catalog currently contains published results from the literature with <i>p</i> &lt 1&times10<sup>-4</sup>. These results are manually curated and quality controlled. Further details of the data extraction process is available in the <a href="{% url 'catalog_documents' %}" >documentation</a>.</p>
